a 2 player game and calculate the value of each hand using the "Value" column and create an if-else statement that says if player 1 or player 2 has more points. Your output should show if Player 1 or Player 2 has more points by saying "Player 1 has more points than Player 2. Player 1: <point value here>, Player 2: <point value here>"
 3 player game and do the same thing as Task 1 and determine who has the highest value hand
